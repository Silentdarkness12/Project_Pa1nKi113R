UNREVIEWED:
-Dual Silenced Pistols
-Dual SMGs with or without silencers
-CVAR: Permanent berserk mode
-Certain other features from Brutal Doom Jay20
-That Realm 667 that looks like a Scrag from Quake, Brutalized
-Switch throwing animation(if possible?)
-A more dynamic health regen system, perhaps using regen stages like Wolfenstein: The New Order
-Build your own Soulsphere! :D
-Chances for fatalities on bosses, I.E the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind
-And of course, the fatalities to go with them
-Something badass for the Hell Rifle
-Smoothen up the kills with the Combat Knife
-Grenade Fatalities!(If you have at least one grenade in your inventory, chance for a fatality where a monster has a live grenade
forced upon them, then they get picked up by the player and thrown as a weapon. Of course, if you're too slow, the monster will
explode violently.
-Adrenaline mechanic: Doing badass things, such as making kills with a rapid-fire weapon in quick succession, using the chainsaw to
kill enemies, or performing fatalities, will fill a meter. When it's full, you can either activate it on demand and gain partial
invulnerability and full health regen for a short time. Optionally, you can let it stay, and if you take a blow that would kill you,
it will automatically activate, giving you a second wind of sorts.
-Grenade Fatalities: Force a live grenade on an enemy and turn him into a mutually assured meat fountain!
-Gotta make a bestiary, I suppose....
-Kickable Grenades!
-Rifle Commando can throw grenades if you're behind cover.
